# Homework5_XB

This project contains the code, data, and report for Homework 5 in ERHS 535. 
The goal of this assignment is to practice data manipulation, visualization, 
and reproducible workflows using R and RMarkdown.

- `data/` – datasets used in the analysis  
- `figures/` – generated figures  
- `writing/` – RMarkdown report and rendered HTML/PDF output
- `Homework5_XB.Rproj` – RStudio project file


# Description / Purpose

This assignment teaches you how to embed version control into a research 
workflow so that the data analysis and results are traceable, reproducible, 
and collaboratively manageable. Rather than juggling separate files or folders 
with different drafts or versions, Git organizes everything including code, 
data, output in a reversible history. This is especially important in research 
settings (like data analysis in R) where reproducibility, transparency, and the 
ability to track how results were generated are essential.

# Requirements
- R version 4.3 or higher
- Required packages: tidyverse, knitr, readr, ggplot2

# How to Run
1. Open the R project (.Rproj file).
2. Open the RMarkdown file in the writing/ folder.
3. Click Knit to produce the final report.
